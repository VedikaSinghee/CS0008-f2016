\f0\fs24 \cf0 For the following homework I referenced my previous homework. Firstly, I initialized the total distance, files and number of lines to 0. Then we dictionary mapped all the participants and ensured that multiple participant occurrences are taken care of. Then the master file is asked to be read which is the txt fie containing all the file names that need to be read. Then each individual file is read and partial data is added to the total data. Then finding the maximum and minimum distance ran by the participants between all three files. Then the writing output where all the files are combined in a cvs file. }
